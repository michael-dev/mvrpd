mvrpd
=====

This daemon implements MVRP (supersedes GRVP) for linux bridges. It aims at automatically configuring vlans on links, especially inter-bridge/inter-switch.

overview
--------

naive approach: 
  * Given a tree of network devices like an ethernet spanning tree.
  * The information of any device that is interested in a VLAN is then propagated along all edges.
  * Any switch that has two or more ports that are interested in the same VLAN adds the VLAN to these ports.

mvrp approach:
  * The switch records which ports are interested in a VLAN, either because they declared interest for a VLAN using MVRP or because it is configured manually.
  * The switch declares interest in a VLAN on each dynamic (MVRP-enabled) port, that indicates whether there are other ports on itself that also want this VLAN by registering for that VLAN.
  * If the bridge has two or more ports that are interested in a VLAN, it will activate (aka configure or register) the VLAN on all interested ports.

mvrpd
-----

This daemon scans a set of bridge ports (defaults to all non-dynamic and the bridge itself) for VLANs it is statically configured to be interested it.
Additionally, it listens on all dynamic (MVRP-enabled) ports for other devices or bridges interested in a VLAN.

If a bridge is interested in a VLAN, it registers for that VLAN on all dynamic ports. If a port is the only one interested in a VLAN, it is not registering for that VLAN (no loopback).

If a bridge has two or more ports that are interested in a VLAN, it will configure that VLAN on all interested ports.

Optionally, some VLANs may be skipped.

This daemon operates on vlan\_filtering enabled linux bridges.

cmdline
-------

  * --bridge <bridgename> (exactly once)
  * --uplinkif <pattern> : matches interfaces that are configured using MVRP (maybe repeated, takes precedence over --epif)
  * --epif <pattern> : matches interfaces that are statically configured (maybe repeated, ususally includes the bridge itself)
  * --ptpif <pattern> : matches interfaces. If those are configured by MVRP, it is assumed the at most one MVRP-enabled applicant (peer) is connected to this bridge port (e.g. another MVRP enabled bridge)
  * --ignore-vlan <vlan-id>: ignore this vlan id
  * --restrict-to-ep: only declare (announce) and thus register (configure) VLANs that are already added to the (statically configured) ports

Where pattern is matched using fnmatch, e.g. eth\* would match eth0, eth1, etc.

extra cmdline
-------------

  * --bridge-dump-netlink: dump netlink messages send/received in bridge module
  * --debug
  * --debug-all
  * --debug-bridge
  * --debug-ether
  * --debug-mvrp
  * --debug-nflog
  * --debug-port
  * --nflog-group: nflog group for MVRP snooping
  * --verbose
